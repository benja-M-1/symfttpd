### Symfttpd 2.1.4 released! ###

A new Symfttpd just arrived in town. This new version has undergone a major facelift for, I hope, a better maintanability and more efficiency!

Symfttpd now uses the Event Dispatcher component of the greate Symfony Components suite to start and stop the server and its associated gateway! 

The ServerInterface has also been reworked, now each server has its own class (as it was the case some versions back) which makes some verifications about the configuration easier.

Furthermore, I changed the way Symfttpd loads the configuration file. It uses the Loader of the Config component. This will make me able to add yaml support for the configuration file in future release (or json)!

Finally, the Lighttpd support is fixed. Since the version 2.1.2, Symfttpd was unable to run Lighttpd due to some mistakes in the Lighttpd configuration which are now fixedâ€¦

Here is the link to [download it](http://benja-M-1.github.com/symfttpd/downloads/symfttpd.phar).


If you face issues with this new version feel free to create a Github issue!

Happy coding :)
