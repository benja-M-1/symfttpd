### Here it is! ###

Finally Symfttpd got its own "website" from where you can download the latest version as a ```.phar``` file. I will use the site as a blog to, to post about Symfttpd evolution, releases and news.

Next step is the documentation, I will try to publish it here as soon as I can. For the moment you can checkout the [README file](https://github.com/benja-M-1/symfttpd/blob/master/README.md) on the Symfttpd's [repository](https://github.com/benja-M-1/symfttpd).
