### Symfttpd 2.1.3 released! ###

I just released Symfttpd 2.1.3, as always you can [download it](http://benja-M-1.github.com/symfttpd/downloads/symfttpd.phar).

In this new release I fixed the version type issue with symfony projects. Moreover, the lighttpd configuration is better rendered and should work now.

If you want to download previouses versions of symfttpd you can find them on the [releases page](http://benja-M-1.github.com/symfttpd/releases.html).
