### Symfttpd 2.1.2 released! ###

I just released Symfttpd 2.1.2, you can [download it](http://benja-M-1.github.com/symfttpd/downloads/symfttpd.phar).

There is nothing new in this version, just some fixes or improvements.  
The self-update commande is now only available for the phar version. If you installed Symfttpd with Composer then you only have to update it running ```$ php composer.phar update benjaM1/symfttpd```.  
Symfttpd prefers guessing the type of your project instead of setting it to ```php```by default. So from now, you can run Symfttpd without ```symfttpd.conf.php```file in your Symfony 2 project.
