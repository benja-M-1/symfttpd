# How do I pronounce it?!

lighttpd being pronounced lighty, I recommend symfy.


# How do I use it?

    cd /path/to/example.com/config
    ln -s /path/to/symfttpd/genconf.php ./lighttpd.php

lighttpd config:

    $HTTP["host"] == "example.com" {
      include_shell "/path/to/example.com/config/lighttpd.php"
    }


# How is the /sf/ alias handled?
Since now plugins’ web dirs are handled by symbolic links, using an alias in the server config for /sf doesn’t make sense. A tool to create the symbolic links should be coming soon.
