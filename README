# How do I pronounce it?!

lighttpd being pronounced lighty, I recommend symfy.


# How do I use it?

    cd /path/to/example.com/config
    ln -s /path/to/symfttpd/genconf.php ./lighttpd.php

lighttpd config:

    $HTTP["host"] == "example.com" {
      include_shell "/path/to/example.com/config/lighttpd.php"
    }

You have to restart lighttpd each time you add a file the the web/
root. Hopefully it doesn’t happen often. Also, don’t forget to run
`php symfony plugin:publish-assets` before.

# How is the /sf/ alias handled?
Since now plugins’ web dirs are handled by symbolic links,
using an alias in the server config for /sf doesn’t make sense.
There is a tool to create the symlink:

    cd /path/to/example.com
    /path/to/symfttpd/symlinksf.php

It should work with symfony from 1.0 to 1.4.
